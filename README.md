# Pixelfin ‚Äì Jellyfin Image Inspector

Do you want your images on your Jellyfin instance to be perfect?

Do you ever wonder which image types you're missing?

Pixelfin is a little Flask app + generator script that lets you quickly produce HTML galleries of your Jellyfin libraries, showing which image types (Primary, ClearArt, Backdrops, Logos, etc.) are present ‚Äî and which ones are missing. It creates a clear, scrollable gallery with clickable images and a missing-image summary table. Titles in the table link directly to their entries, and entry titles connect you to the corresponding media item in Jellyfin, allowing you to quickly edit or add images.

I built this entirely with **ChatGPT**, because I have **literally zero coding experience**. It works for me, and I personally use it to keep track of artwork across my Jellyfin setup. If you‚Äôre better at coding than me (which is basically everyone), feel free to improve it or collaborate ‚Äî I‚Äôd love that.

## üôã About This Project

This project is **functional, not perfect or polished**.
 
I have **literally zero coding experience** ‚Äî everything here was stitched together with the help of ChatGPT. I thought it might be useful to someone else, so I decided to share it. Please be kind and patient if you run into rough edges.

If you try it out:
- Sometimes things just need a **restart**.  
- Make sure `history.json` exists as an **empty file**, not a folder.
- Depending on the size of the library, it can take some time.   

This tool works for me, and I actively use it to manage artwork in my own Jellyfin setup. If you‚Äôre more experienced, you‚Äôll almost certainly see ways to improve it. Contributions, fixes, and feedback are all very welcome, but I honestly wouldn't know how to act upon them without help. I'm just being real with you. I‚Äôd love to collaborate with anyone who finds this interesting.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Web interface (Flask app)**
	- Enter your Jellyfin server, API key, and library name
	- Choose colors for the gallery
	- Select which image types to include
	- Generate new HTML reports
	- View previously generated galleries, download them with embedded images, or delete them
- **Automatic galleries (generate_html.py)**
	- Each item in the library with its images
	- Missing images highlighted with placeholders
	- A summary table at the top listing which image types each item is missing; clicking on a title directs you to that entry
	- Clickable images with a lightbox viewer (Prev / Next / Close)
- **Direct links to Jellyfin**
	
	Each item‚Äôs title links directly to its page in Jellyfin‚Äôs web UI so you can take action and make edits.
	
- **Image resolution display**
	
	Under every image, it shows the resolution (e.g. 1920√ó1080).
	
- **Missing image callouts**
	
	For each entry, missing image types are listed in red so you don‚Äôt miss them.

## üöÄ Installation (Without Docker)

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Pip
- A Jellyfin server + API key

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask pillow requests

```

### Run the app

```bash
python app.py

```

Then open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:1280

```

---

## üê≥ Running with Docker

If you prefer Docker, you can run it without installing Python locally.

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 1280:1280 \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \ # where HTML files go
  -v $(pwd)/assets:/app/assets \
  -v $(pwd)/history.json:/app/history.json \
  --name pixelfin \
  ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/pixelfin:latest

```

- `output/` will store the generated HTML reports

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:1280`.

---

## üêô Docker Compose

Here‚Äôs a simple `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  pixelfin:
    image: ghcr.io/nothing2obvi/pixelfin:latest
    container_name: pixelfin
    ports:
      - "1280:1280"
    volumes:
      - ./output:/app/output # where HTML files go
      - ./assets:/app/assets
      - ./history.json:/app/history.json
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run it with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## üõ† How It Works

1. Start the app (`python app.py` or via Docker). See `About this Project` if it's not working.
2. Fill in:
	- **Server URL** ‚Äì your Jellyfin base URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8096`)
	- **Library Name** ‚Äì the library you want to inspect (e.g. `Movies`)
	- **API Key** ‚Äì create this in Jellyfin‚Äôs admin dashboard
	- Pick colors and image types if you want
3. Hit **Generate**.
	- A background thread calls `generate_html.py`, which talks to Jellyfin‚Äôs API, fetches all your items, and checks every image type.
	- A timestamped `.html` file gets saved under `output/<LibraryName>/`.
4. Browse results:
	- View the gallery in your browser
	- Click an item‚Äôs title to jump directly into Jellyfin and fix missing images
	- Download an ‚Äúembedded‚Äù version where all images are base64-encoded (for sharing/archiving)

---

## üìä Example Gallery

- **Top summary table** ‚Äì shows each item with checkmarks where images are missing
- **Entries below** ‚Äì each item gets its own block with:
	- Left column: Primary, Thumb, ClearArt, Menu
	- Right column: Backdrop, Banner, Box, BoxRear, Disc, Logo
	- Missing image placeholders in red
	- Resolution labels under each image
	- ‚ÄúScroll to top‚Äù links for easy navigation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Error handling is minimal
- Only tested with my setup (Mac + Jellyfin 10.10.7)
- Only tested with the following library types: Shows, Movies, Music Videos, Music

---

## ü§ù Want to Improve This?

If you know Python, Flask, or front-end design, there‚Äôs a ton of room to make this better:

- Cleaner UI
- Smarter caching
- Async image fetching
- Export to other formats (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- Per-library configs

I‚Äôd be really interested in collaborating if anyone else likes this idea.
