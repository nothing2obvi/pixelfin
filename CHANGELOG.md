This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## v0.34.7 – 2025-10-07

#### Changed
- **Lightbox interaction:** Removed `<a>` wrapper around the lightbox image to prevent automatic downloads or opening in a new tab.
- **Click handling:** Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` on image clicks inside the lightbox to stop default browser actions while preserving next-image cycling.

#### Fixed
- **Image click behavior:** Clicking an image in the lightbox no longer triggers a file download or opens a new browser tab.
- **Lightbox navigation:** Maintained full support for next/previous image cycling, arrow-key navigation, and closing with `Esc` or outside clicks.

---

## v0.34.6 – 2025-10-07

#### Added
- **Lightbox “Open in New Tab” support:** Users can now right-click or middle-click any image (in both the gallery and lightbox views) to open it directly in a new browser tab instead of downloading it.
- **Version label in GitHub view link:** Added display of the current app version (`v0.34.6`) next to “View on GitHub” in the HTML generation success message.

#### Changed
- **Anchor behavior:** All image anchors now include `target="_blank"` and direct image URLs, preserving lightbox behavior on normal clicks while enabling native browser tab opening.
- **Lightbox markup:** The lightbox image is now wrapped in a clickable `<a id="lightbox-link" href="" target="_blank">` element so full-size images can also be opened directly.

#### Fixed
- **Right-click behavior:** Resolved issue where “Open image in new tab” would download instead of open when triggered from gallery or lightbox.
- **Backdrop labeling:** Single backdrops are now labeled “Backdrop,” while multiple backdrops display as “Backdrop (0),” “Backdrop (1),” etc. for clarity.

---

## v0.34.5 – 2025-10-07

#### Added
- **Backdrops (multi-index support):** Added full detection of `BackdropImageTags`, enabling retrieval and display of every available backdrop (`Backdrop/0`, `Backdrop/1`, etc.).
- **ZIP packaging:** Now includes all backdrop images in each item’s folder as `backdrop01`, `backdrop02`, etc. (or using the overridden base name like `background01`, `background02`).

#### Changed
- **HTML generation:** Backdrops section now iterates through all detected backdrops and displays them sequentially in the right column.
- **Lightbox behavior:** Now automatically includes all backdrops (and other images) in the same slideshow sequence for each item.
- **ZIP naming:** Numeric suffixes in ZIP outputs are now zero-padded (`backdrop01`, `backdrop02`, etc.) for cleaner sorting.

#### Fixed
- **Single-backdrop limitation:** Resolved issue where only one backdrop image was being displayed or downloaded even when multiple existed.
- **Consistency in backdrop handling:** HTML and ZIP logic now share unified multi-tag detection, ensuring both reflect the same image set.

## v0.34.4 - 2025-09-07
